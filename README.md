# Three.js Journey Lessons

This repository contains the lessons and projects I created while learning WebGL and Three.js as part of the Three.js Journey Course by Bruno Simon. These lessons cover various WebGL and Three.js concepts, and they are organized by topics in separate folders.

## Prerequisites

Before running the projects in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installation

For each lesson/project in this repository that includes a `package.json` file, follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Navigate to the specific lesson's folder using the terminal.

2. Run one of the following commands to install the project dependencies:
   `yarn install (or npm install)`

## Running the Projects

Once you've installed the project dependencies, you can run each lesson or project by using the provided scripts in the package.json file(if available). Typically, you can start a development server by running:
`yarn dev (or npm run dev)`

This will start a local development server and open the project in your web browser. You can access the project at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified).
